	abstract = {Background
Esophageal perforation after aortic replacement/stenting for aortic dissection or aneurysm is a rare but severe complication. However, its cause, standard treatment, and prognosis are unclear. We analyzed the treatment and outcome retrospectively from seven cases experienced at our hospital.

Case presentation
The median age of the patients was 70 years (range, 41–86), and six of the seven cases were male. As the first treatment, aortic replacement techniques were performed in five, and thoracic endovascular aortic repair ({TEVAR}) procedure was performed in two. We evaluated the treatment of the perforation, the cause of death, and the median survival time after reparative surgery (esophagectomy)., Initial treatment of the perforation was esophagectomy without reconstruction in six and esophagogastric bypass (later, esophagectomy was performed) in one. Three of seven cases could be discharged from hospital or moved to another hospital, but two of these three cases died of major bleeding on postoperative days 320 and 645. The other four esophagectomy cases died in hospital because of sepsis on postoperative days 14, 30, and 41 and major bleeding on postoperative day 54. The one surviving case was a 65-year-old man who underwent reconstruction, and was still alive without signs of infection at 424 days postoperatively.

Conclusion
The prognosis of esophageal perforation cases after aortic replacement/stenting for thoracic aortic dissection or aneurysm is poor, though there were some cases with relatively long survival. Therefore, the indication for invasive esophagectomy should be decided carefully. Control of infection including regional infection is essential for successful treatment.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jvs.2010.11.124},
	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: This study analyzed 1-year outcome after thoracic endovascular aortic repair ({TEVAR}) in patients with complicated type B aortic dissection ({cTBAoD}) who had rupture or malperfusion and symptom onset ≤14 days (acute), 15 to 30 days (subacute), and 31 to 90 days (chronic) until required intervention. The main focus of this report is primarily on the acute cohort.
{METHODS}: Clinical data were systematically collected from five physician-sponsored investigational device exemption ({IDE}) clinical trials between 2000 and 2008 using standardized definitions and forms. Adverse events were reported early (≤30 days) and late ({\textgreater}30 days) by body system. Major adverse events included death, stroke, myocardial infarction, renal failure, respiratory failure, paralysis, and bowel ischemia.
{RESULTS}: There were 99 {cTBAoD} patients: 85 were acute, 11 were subacute, and 3 were chronic. Among the acute patients, 31.8\% had rupture and 71.8\% had malperfusion, including 55.7\% lower extremity, 36.1\% renal, 19.7\% visceral, 8.2\% other, and 3.3\% spinal cord (patients may have more than one source). Rupture and malperfusion were both reported for three acute patients. Additional findings for the acute cohort included pain (76.5\%), hypertension (43.5\%), and bleeding (8.2\%); comorbidities included hypertension (83.5\%), current/past smoking history (69.8\%), and diabetes (12.9\%). The main focus of this analysis was the acute cohort (n = 85). Age averaged 59 years (72.9\% male). Early adverse events included pulmonary (36.5\%), vascular (28.2\%), renal (25.9\%), and neurologic (23.5\%). Early major adverse events occurred in 37.6\% of patients, including death (10.6\%), stroke (9.4\%), renal failure (9.4\%), and paralysis (9.4\%); late adverse events included vascular (15.8\%), cardiac (10.5\%), gastrointestinal (6.6\%), and hemorrhage (5.3\%). The point-estimate mortality rate was 10.8 (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 4.1-17.5) at 30 days and 29.4 (95\% {CI}, 18.4-40.4) at 1 year, when 34 patients remained at risk.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Emergency {TEVAR} for patients with {cTBAoD} (malperfusion or rupture) provided acceptable mortality and morbidity results out to 1 year. Manufacturers can use this 30-day mortality point-estimate of 10.8 (95\% {CI}, 4.1-17.5) for the acute cohort to establish a performance goal for use in single-arm commercial {IDE} trials if the Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory bodies concur.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Thoracic endovascular aortic repair ({TEVAR}) is applicable to a spectrum of thoracic aortic pathology with half of the procedures performed world-wide for indications other than degenerative aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta ({DTA}). This multicenter, prospective study queried perioperative and one-year results of {TEVAR} using the commercially available {GORE} {TAG} device, in the treatment of acute complicated Type B dissection ({cTBD}), traumatic aortic tear ({TT}), and ruptured degenerative aneurysm ({RDA}) of the {DTA}.
{METHODS}: This prospective, non-randomized, literature controlled study included 59 patients; {cTBD}, n = 19; {RDA}, n = 20; {TT}, n = 20. The primary end-point was the composite of death and total paraplegia in subjects at {\textless}or= 30 days post-treatment compared with a cohort from current literature. Secondary end-points included adverse events related to device, procedural and systemic complications, and one-year survival.
{RESULTS}: All 59 patients had successful endoprosthesis deployment. Fifteen of 19 (79\%) patients in the {cTBD} group had either rupture or malperfusion syndromes at presentation. Combined 30-day mortality/paraplegia rate was 13.6\% (8/59), with seven (11.9\%) deaths ({cTBD} [3], {RDA} [3] and {TT} [1]) and 1 ({TT}, 1.7\%) case of paraplegia. The primary end-point for the {TEVAR} cohort was significantly lower (P = .008) when compared with a composite literature control of 800 patients (combined 30-day mortality/paraplegia of 29.6\%). Thirty-day complications of any nature occurred in 48 (81\%) patients; 11 (18.6\%) were device related, and 43 (73\%) experienced one or more systemic adverse events. Six (10\%) patients required additional {TEVAR} implantations and 3 (5\%) patients (one in each pathology group) required conversion to open surgery. Seventeen (29\%) patients had endoleaks of any kind or degree through 30 days; {cTBD} (7), {TT} (2), {RDA} (8). Nine patients (15.3\%) had perioperative strokes with two resultant deaths. During mean follow-up time of 409 +/- 309 days, an additional 12 patients died, one patient required open conversion ({cTBD}), and two patients had major device related events. Actuarial survival at one year was 66\% (range, 52\%-77\%) for the entire cohort; ({cTBD}) 79\% (range, 53\%-92\%), ({TT}) 79\% (range, 53\%-92\%) and ({RDA}) 37\% (range, 16\%-59\%). On regression analysis, age at treatment (1.05 [range, 1.01-1.09]; P = .008) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}) (4.3 [range, 1.3-14.4]; P = .02) were predictive of death at one year.
{CONCLUSION}: This study confirmed treatment advantages for {TEVAR} for thoracic aortic catastrophes when compared with literature-based results of open repair. One-year treatment results indicate a low incidence of graft-related complications. {TEVAR} is the preferred initial treatment for the {DTA} catastrophes studied herein.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Acute esophageal necrosis, which presents as a black esophagus on endoscopy, is a rare disorder that is poorly described in the medical literature. In this study, we analyze all cases reported to date to define risk factors, clinical presentation, endoscopic features, histologic appearance, treatment, complications, outcome and etiopathogenesis of the disease and to describe a distinct medical syndrome and propose a staging system.
{METHODS}: We searched Medline and {PubMed} from January 1965 to February 2006 for English-language articles using the key words "acute esophageal necrosis," "necrotizing esophagitis," and "black esophagus."
{RESULTS}: A total of 88 patients were reported in the literature during the 40 years, 70 men and 16 women with an average age of 67 years. Patients were generally admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding and cardiovascular event/shock. Patients presented with hematemesis and melena in more than 70\% of the cases. Upper endoscopy showed black, diffusely necrotic esophageal mucosa predominantly affecting the distal third of the organ. Necrosis was confirmed histologically in most cases. Complications included strictures or stenoses, mediastinitis/abscesses, and perforations. Overall mortality was 31.8\%.
{CONCLUSIONS}: This study provides a structured approach to identifying risk factors, diagnosis, and pathogenesis of the acute esophageal necrosis. Risk factors include age, male sex, cardiovascular disease, hemodynamic compromise, gastric outlet obstruction, alcohol ingestion, malnutrition, diabetes, renal insufficiency, hypoxemia, hypercoagulable state, and trauma. Mechanism of damage is usually multifactorial secondary to ischemic compromise, acute gastric outlet obstruction, and malnutrition. Overall, acute esophageal necrosis should be viewed as a poor prognostic factor, associated with high mortality from the underlying clinical disease.},

	abstract = {Acute esophageal necrosis is a rare syndrome classically characterized by a striking endoscopic image of diffuse and circumferential black mucosal discoloration of distal esophagus, with an abrupt transition at the gastroesophageal junction and variable proximal extension. The typical patient is an older male with general debilitation and multiple comorbidities presenting with hematemesis or melena. The pathophysiology usually involves a combination of esophageal ischemia, backflow injury from gastric chemical contents and impaired mucosal reparative mechanisms associated with debilitated physical states. It may arise in the setting of hemodynamic compromise, diabetic ketoacidosis, hypothermia, alcoholic intoxication, trauma, inflammatory diseases, esophageal local infection, solid organ transplantation, postoperative status, drugs or acute gastric outlet obstruction, usually in the background of a chronic debilitating process, where the concurrent presence of multiple risk factors, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, malnutrition, malignancy or alcohol abuse, places a patient at higher risk. The characteristic endoscopic appearance establishes the diagnosis. Biopsy is supportive but not required. Management is mainly supportive and consists of correcting coexisting conditions, fluid therapy, bowel rest, intravenous proton pump inhibitor therapy and red blood cell transfusion as needed. Although this is a serious life-threatening condition, appropriate treatment may result in a favorable outcome in the majority of patients.},

This type of dysphagia is called dysphagia aortica. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair is nowadays the treatment of choice for anatomically suitable patients experiencing complicated Type B aortic dissection. Oesophageal necrosis is a rare but fatal complication following thoracic endovascular aortic repair. Extrinsic oesophageal compression by the thrombosed aneurysmal sac, a mediastinal haematoma or extensive thrombosis in the false lumen of a dissected aorta and acute vascular occlusion of the oesophageal supply are possible mechanisms. When oesophageal necrosis is suspected, endoscopic examination and computed tomography imaging should be performed repeatedly. Oesophagoscopy will confirm the diagnosis revealing a black, diffusely necrotic and ulcerated oesophageal mucosa. It is critical to intervene before full-thickness oesophageal wall necrosis and mediastinitis occur. Guidelines are absent because of the rarity of this complication. Moreover, lack of a large series does not permit the establishment of guidelines either. However, oesophagectomy of the impaired oesophagus is the only chance for survival. Unfortunately, survival rates are disappointing. Prevention and awareness is the cornerstone of success. Early endoscopic examination when oesophageal necrosis is suspected due to even minimal symptoms will detect this fatal menace on time.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: To review the incidence, clinical presentation, definite management and 1-year outcome in patients with aorto-oesophageal fistulation ({AOF}) following thoracic endovascular aortic repair ({TEVAR}).
{METHODS}: International multicentre registry (European Registry of Endovascular Aortic Repair Complications) between 2001 and 2011 with a total caseload of 2387 {TEVAR} procedures (17 centres).
{RESULTS}: Thirty-six patients with a median age of 69 years ({IQR} 56-75), 25\% females and 9 patients (19\%) following previous aortic surgery were identified. The incidence of {AOF} in the entire cohort after {TEVAR} in the study period was 1.5\%. The primary underlying aortic pathology for {TEVAR} was atherosclerotic aneurysm formation in 53\% of patients and the median time to development of {AOF} was 90 days ({IQR} 30-150). Leading clinical symptoms were fever of unknown origin in 29 (81\%), haematemesis in 19 (53\%) and shock in 8 (22\%) patients. Diagnosis could be confirmed via computed tomography in 92\% of the cases with the leading sign of a new mediastinal mass in 28 (78\%) patients. A conservative approach resulted in a 100\% 1-year mortality, and 1-year survival for an oesophageal stenting-only approach was 17\%. Survival after isolated oesophagectomy was 43\%. The highest 1-year survival rate (46\%) could be achieved via an aggressive treatment including radical oesophagectomy and aortic replacement [relative risk increase 1.73 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 1.03-2.92]. The survival advantage of this aggressive treatment modality could be confirmed in bootstrap analysis (95\% {CI} 1.11-3.33).
{CONCLUSIONS}: The development of {AOF} is a rare but lethal complication after {TEVAR}, being associated with the need for emergency {TEVAR} as well as mediastinal haematoma formation. The only durable and successful approach to cure the disease is radical oesophagectomy and extensive aortic reconstruction.

To investigate the indications and outcomes of cervical esophagostomy, we reviewed the use of this operation at {UCLA} Medical Center over the last 20 years as employed for esophageal leaks. Eighteen patients underwent this procedure for the following indications: leak with malignant tracheoesophageal fistula (11\%), anastomotic leak (44\%), endoscopic injury (18\%), gunshot wound (5.5\%), operative injury (11\%), corrosive ingestion (11\%), and spontaneous rupture (5.5\%). Overall mortality directly attributable to sepsis was 33 per cent. Of the surviving patients, 67 per cent later underwent reconstruction. Seventy-two per cent of patients had end esophagostomies, and the remainder had loop diversions. The primary indication for operation in these patients was persistent sepsis after initial surgical management of esophageal spillage into the mediastinum or neck. This series suggests that cervical esophagostomy, when applied to the appropriate patient population, can decrease mortality and allow subsequent alimentary reconstruction.},

The pathological findings of an oesophageal fistula following {TEVAR} are reviewed here. This report presents the case of a 68-year-old man with a stent graft-related oesophageal fistula after {TEVAR} for {TAA}. The oesophageal fistula suddenly appeared on the 11th day after {TEVAR}, and oesophagectomy was performed, without stent graft extirpation. The pathological findings showed neutrophil infiltration from the adventitia to the mucosa and congestion in the capillaries of the oesophageal wall around the site of penetration and no bacterial infection. There have been reports with logical hypotheses about the causes of stent graft-related oesophageal fistulae. Our pathological findings support the theory that pressure necrosis or ischaemic insult by physical compression of a rigid thrombosed aneurysm may result in fistula formation. For descending aortic aneurysms that protrude toward the oesophagus, caution must be exercised to prevent oesophageal fistula formation after {TEVAR}.},

{METHODS}: We conducted a voluntary national survey among Italian universities and hospital centres with a thoracic endovascular programme.
{RESULTS}: Thirty-nine centres were contacted, and 17 participated. Of the patients who underwent {TEVAR} between 1998 and 2008, 19/1113 (1.7\%) developed {AEF}/{ABF}. Among indications to {TEVAR}, aortic pseudo-aneurysm was associated with the development of late {AEF}/{ABF} (P = 0.009). Further, emergent and complicated procedures resulted in increased risk of {AEF}/{ABF} (P = 0.008 and P {\textless} 0.001, respectively). Eight patients were treated conservatively, all of whom died within 30 days. Eleven patients underwent {AEF}/{ABF} surgical treatment, with a perioperative mortality of 64\% (7/11). At a mean follow-up of 17.7 +/- 12.5 months, overall survival was 16\% (3/19).
{CONCLUSIONS}: The incidence of {AEF} and {ABF} following {TEVAR} is not negligible, and is comparable to that following open repair. This finding warrants an ad hoc long-term follow-up after {TEVAR}, particularly in patients submitted to emergent and complicated procedures. Both surgical and endovascular treatment of {AEF}/{ABF} are associated with high mortality. However, conservative treatment does not appear to be a viable option.},

{METHOD}: A 72-year-old man with thoracoabdominal aneurysm type I and dysphagia underwent an emergent carotico-carotid bypass in combination with thoracic endovascular aortic aneurysm repair starting at a point distal to the brachiocephalic trunk and ending proximal to the superior mesenteric artery. On day 12, a decortication was performed for treating an infection in the remaining hematoma. However, further deterioration occurred as a result of mediastinitis secondary to the transmural necrosis of the middle third of the esophagus combined with accompanying mediastinitis. The patient's family refused to give consent for further treatment by esophagectomy. He died 24 days after the initial operation.
{CONCLUSION}: Dysphagia aortica, mucosal abnormalities on esophagogastroscopy, and mediastinal compression by hematoma at the time of rupture draws our attention toward ischemia of the esophagus after thoracic endovascular aortic aneurysm repair. Repeated esophagoscopy can provide us with the opportunity to act before full thickness necrosis and mediastinitis occur.},

The morbidity and mortality rate is directly related to the delay in diagnosis and initiation of optimum treatment. The reported mortality from treated esophageal perforation is 10\% to 25\%, when therapy is initiated within 24 hours of perforation, but it could rise up to 40\% to 60\% when the treatment is delayed beyond 48 hours. Primary closure of the perforation site and wide drainage of the mediastinum is recommended if perforation is detected in less than 24 hours. Treatment option for delayed or missed rupture of esophagus is not very clear and is controversial. Recently a substantial number of patients with esophageal perforation are being managed by nonoperative measures. Patients with small perforations and minimal extraesophageal involvement may be better managed by nonoperative treatment Major prognostic factors determining mortality are the etiology and site of the injury, the presence of underlying esophageal pathology, the delay in diagnosis and the method of treatment. For optimum outcome for management of esophageal perforations in adults a multidisciplinary approach is needed.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The Pittsburgh group has suggested a perforation severity score ({PSS}) for better decision making in the management of esophageal perforation. Our study aim was to determine whether the {PSS} can be used to stratify patients with esophageal perforation into distinct subgroups with differential outcomes in an independent study population.
{METHODS}: In a retrospective study cases of esophageal perforation were collected (study-period, 1990-2014). The {PSS} was analyzed using logistic regression as a continuous variable and stratified into low, intermediate, and high score groups.
{RESULTS}: Data for 288 patients (mean age, 59.9 years) presenting with esophageal perforation (during the period 1990-2014) were abstracted. Etiology was spontaneous (Boerhaave; n = 119), iatrogenic (instrumentation; n = 85), and traumatic perforation (n = 84). Forty-three patients had coexisting esophageal cancer. The mean {PSS} was 5.82, and was significantly higher in patients with fatal outcome (n = 57; 19.8\%; mean {PSS}, 9.79 vs 4.84; P {\textless} .001). Mean {PSS} was also significantly higher in patients receiving operative management (n = 200; 69\%; mean {PSS}, 6.44 vs 4.40; P {\textless} .001). Using the Pittsburgh strata, patients were assigned to low {PSS} (≤2; n = 63), intermediate {PSS} (3-5; n = 86), and high {PSS} ({\textgreater}5; n = 120) groups. Perforation-related morbidity, length of stay, frequency of operative treatment, and mortality increased with increasing {PSS} strata. Patients with high {PSS} were 3.37 times more likely to have operative management compared with low {PSS}.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The Pittsburgh {PSS} reliably reflects the seriousness of esophageal perforation and stratifies patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups with differential morbidity and mortality outcomes.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: Traditionally esophageal perforation is a rare clinical emergency that confers a high rate of mortality and major morbidity. The objective of this study was to establish the annual rate and mortality from esophageal perforation and determine the effect of hospital volume on clinical outcomes.
{METHODS}: Hospital Episode Statistics database was used for the identification of patients admitted to hospitals within England with esophageal perforation between 2001 and 2012. The influence of hospital volume and treatment approach upon clinical outcomes was analyzed using multivariable analysis to control for patient age and medical comorbidities that may influence outcome.
{RESULTS}: Over the 12-year study period 2,564 patients with esophageal perforation were treated at 158 hospitals. The 30- and 90-day mortality rates were 30.0 and 38.8\%, respectively. Esophageal perforation etiology was spontaneous in 81.9\% and iatrogenic in 5.9\% of cases. There was a significant increase in the percentage of patients managed supportively and a reduction in surgical management over time. Furthermore there were significant reductions in 30-day (36.6\% to 24.9\%; P{\textless}0.001) and 90-day mortality (44.1\% to 35.4\%; P=0.006) over the 12-year study period. Important patient demographics associated with 30- and 90-day mortality included age ≥70 years, preoperative congestive cardiac failure, ischemic heart, liver, and renal disease. High hospital volume was associated with significant reductions in 30- (odds ratio ({OR})=0.68; P=0.001) and 90-day mortality ({OR}=0.69; P=0.001). In a subset analysis of patients undergoing endoscopic intervention, hospital volume was identified as an important factor associated with mortality.
{CONCLUSIONS}: This study provides evidence for the centralization of management of esophageal perforation to high volume centers with appropriate multi-disciplinary infrastructure to treat these complex patients.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}/{AIMS}: In spite of the progress made during the last few decades, esophageal perforation continues to carry a serious prognosis. The aim of this study is to present our experience with surgical treatment of esophageal perforation.
{METHODOLOGY}: Eight patients with esophageal perforation were submitted to surgical treatment with varying time intervals between the perforation and the operation. The surgical technique was individualized according to the location of the perforation and the severity of the local inflammatory and necrotic findings. Follow-up data was obtained by follow-up examination or telephone contact with the family doctors. The medical records were reviewed. The cause, the location and the clinical manifestations of perforation, the underlying esophageal disease, the imaging techniques and other examinations which were used to establish diagnosis, the time interval between the perforation and the operation, the surgical techniques, the outcome, the complications, the duration of postoperative hospitalization, and the late results were analyzed.
{RESULTS}: The perforation was due to iatrogenic injury in 6 of 8 patients. Underlying esophageal disease was present in 4 patients. The mean time interval between the perforation and the operation was 4.3 days. Primary repair was attempted in 5 patients, exclusion-diversion of the esophagus in 2 and thorough drainage in 1 patient. There was no mortality. Primary closure was achieved in 80\% of the patients in whom primary repair was attempted. Seven out of 8 patients were alive 46-150 (mean, 99.12) months after the operation.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Surgery is the treatment of choice for patients with esophageal perforation including those seen more than 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. The chosen surgical technique depends on the location of perforation and the severity of local inflammatory and necrotic findings.},

	abstract = {Posterior Mediastinal Hematomas ({PMHs}) secondary to a fall from standing height are uncommon, with only one previous case reported in the literature. We describe a case of a 78-year-old male with multiple medical comorbidities, who was transferred to Montreal General Hospital ({MGH}) with a posterior mediastinal hematoma ({PMH}) after sustaining a fall from standing height. On initial assessment, the patient was hemodynamically stable and complained of mild chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue, and diaphoresis. The patient's airway was secured via endotracheal intubation fearing impending respiratory compromise secondary to an enlarging {PMH}. The patient was admitted to {ICU} where over the next 3 days he was managed conservatively via careful monitoring of his hemodynamic and hematologic indices. Repeat {CT} scanning indicated reduction in size of the {PMH}. The patient was discharged on hospital day eight. This case describes the assessment, evaluation, and conservative management of {PMH} in a complicated patient receiving prior anticoagulation. A review of the literature regarding the epidemiology of {PMH} and the management of both unstable and stable {PMHs} is also presented.},
